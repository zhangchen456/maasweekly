Meet Cohere Parse
Today we are releasing Cohere Parse.
Parse (model ID: parse-v5.0) turns complex documents into clean, structured Markdown ready for downstream AI workflows. The 2.3B-parameter multimodal model extracts text in reading order, tables, lists, forms, images and captions, page boundaries, and visual element locations.
Outputs include Markdown/HTML content, HTML-formatted tables, bounding boxes, and image descriptions — preserving both document structure and layout for easier rendering and processing.
Key specs: 8K context window · ~4.6GB model size · Markdown output
Availability
Cohere Parse is available through the Parse API, as well as Microsoft Foundry
and AWS SageMaker
.
For single-tenant deployment, Parse is also available in Model Vault.
For more details, see the model documentation.

We’re pleased to announce the release of Command A+, the last model in the Command A
family of models, combining support for vision inputs, reasoning capabilities, translation capabilities, and
agentic tasks all within the same model. It is also notably our first Mixture of Experts (MoE) model with 25
billion active parameters ands 218 billion total parameters.
Key Features
Agentic Applications: With notable performance increases in tool use and agentic tasks, Command A+ is
the strongest agentic model in the Command family.
Expanded Multilingual Support: With 48 languages supported, including all official EU languages, this
more than doubles the support of languages from our prior models.

Announcing the Cohere Transcribe model
We’re pleased to announce the release of Cohere Transcribe, our first transcription model.
Cohere Transcribe specializes in audio-in, text-out, automatic speech recognition (ASR).
Technical details

Input: Audio waveform
Output: Text
Languages covered: English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Greek, Dutch, Polish,
Vietnamese, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, Korean.
License: Apache 2.0
API endpoint: Audio Transcriptions API
Getting started
The model is available immediately through Cohere’s Audio Transcriptions API endpoint.
You can start transcribing audio using the following example query:
PYTHON
import cohere
co = cohere.ClientV2()
response = co.audio.transcriptions.create(
model="cohere-transcribe-03-2026",
language="en",
file=open("./sample.wav", "rb"),
)
print(response)
Availability
You can access Cohere Transcribe via our API
for free, low-setup experimentation
subject to rate limits. See the Different Types of API Keys and Rate Limits page for
usage details and integration guidance.
For production deployment without rate limits, provision a dedicated Model Vault.
This enables low-latency, private cloud inference without having to manage infrastructure. Pricing is
calculated per hour-instance, with discounted plans for longer-term commitments.
Contact our team
to discuss your requirements.
