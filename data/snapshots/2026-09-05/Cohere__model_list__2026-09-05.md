An Overview of Cohere's Models
Copy page
Cohere has a variety of models that cover many different use cases. If you need more customization, you
can tune your prompts to adjust its behavior to your specific
use case.
Cohere models are currently available on the following platforms:
Cohere’s proprietary platform
Amazon SageMaker
Amazon Bedrock
Microsoft Azure
Oracle GenAI Service
At the end of each major section below, you’ll find technical details about how to call a given model on a
particular platform.
What can These Models Be Used For?
In this section, we’ll provide some high-level context on Cohere’s offerings, and what the strengths of each
are.
The Command family of models includes Command A+, Command A,
Command R7B, Command A Translate,
Command A Reasoning, Command A Vision,
Command R+, Command R, and Command
.
Together, they are the text-generation LLMs powering tool-using agents,
retrieval augmented generation (RAG), translation, copywriting, and
similar use cases. They work through the Chat endpoint, which can be used with or without
RAG.
Rerank is the fastest way to inject the intelligence of a language model into an existing search system. It can be accessed via the Rerank endpoint.
Embed improves the accuracy of search, classification, clustering, and RAG results. It powers the Embed endpoint.
Parse extracts structured, machine-readable data from unstructured enterprise documents, like forms and PDFs. It powers the Parse endpoint.
Cohere Transcribe is Cohere’s dedicated audio transcription model for automatic speech
recognition (ASR). It powers the Audio Transcriptions endpoint.
Cohere Transcribe Arabic is a version of the model optimized for Arabic-language
audio.
The Aya family of models are aimed at expanding the number of languages covered by
generative AI. Aya Expanse covers 23 languages, and Aya Vision is fully multimodal, allowing you to pass
in images and text and get a single coherent response. Both are available on the Chat
endpoint.
Command
Command is Cohere’s default generation model that takes a user instruction (or command) and generates text
following the instruction. Our Command models also have conversational capabilities, meaning they are
well-suited for chat applications, and Command A Vision can interact with image inputs.

Embed
These models can be used to generate embeddings from text or classify it based on various parameters. Embeddings can be used for estimating semantic similarity between two sentences, choosing a sentence which is most likely to follow another sentence, or categorizing user feedback. The Representation model comes with a variety of helper functions, such as for detecting the language of an input.

Rerank
The Rerank model can improve created models by re-organizing their results based on certain parameters. This can be used to improve search algorithms.
|
| Model Name | Description | Modalities | Context Length | Endpoints
| rerank-v4.0-pro | A multilingual model that allows for re-ranking English and non-english documents and semi-structured data (JSON). This model is better suited for state-of-the-art quality and complex use-cases than its fast variant. | Text | 32k | Rerank
| rerank-v4.0-fast | A light version of rerank-v4.0-pro, this is a multilingual model that allows for re-ranking English and non-english documents and semi-structured data (JSON). This model is better suited for low latency and high throughput use-cases than its pro variant. | Text | 32k | Rerank
| rerank-v3.5 | A model that allows for re-ranking English Language documents and semi-structured data (JSON). This model has a context length of 4096 tokens. | Text | 4k | Rerank

Using Rerank Models on Different Platforms
In this table, we provide some important context for using Cohere Rerank models on Amazon Bedrock, SageMaker, and more.

| Model Name | Amazon Bedrock Model ID | Amazon SageMaker | Azure AI Foundry | Oracle OCI Generative AI Service
| rerank-v4.0-pro | N/A | Unique per deployment | cohere-rerank-v4-pro | N/A

| rerank-multilingual-v3.0 | N/A | Unique per deployment | Cohere-rerank-v3-multilingual | N/A
Rerank accepts full strings rather than tokens, so the token limit works a little differently. Rerank will automatically chunk documents longer than 510 tokens, and there is therefore no explicit limit to how long a document can be when using rerank. See our best practice guide for more info about formatting documents for the Rerank endpoint.
Parse
Parse is our vision parsing model for extracting structured data from enterprise documents that can be used in AI search and agentic applications.
