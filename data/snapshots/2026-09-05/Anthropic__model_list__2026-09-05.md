If you're unsure which model to use, start with Claude Opus 5 for most workloads. Use Claude Fable 5.1 for demanding reasoning and long-horizon agentic work, or when your evals on Claude Opus 5 at higher effort still fall short. All current models support text and image input, text output, multilingual capabilities, vision, and tool use. Each model's page lists the platforms it's available on.

Using the Models API
You can query model capabilities and token limits programmatically with the Models API. The response includes max_input_tokens, max_tokens, and a capabilities object for every available model.
Prompt and output performance
Current Claude models excel in:
Performance: Top-tier results in reasoning, coding, multilingual tasks, long-context handling, honesty, and image processing. See Prompting best practices for general and model-specific prompting guidance.
Engaging responses: Claude models are ideal for applications that require rich, human-like interactions. If you prefer more concise responses, adjust your prompts to guide the model toward the desired output length. Refer to the prompt engineering guides for details.
Output quality: When migrating from a previous model generation, you may notice larger improvements in overall performance. If you're on Claude Opus 4.8 or earlier, see Migrating to Claude Opus 5.
