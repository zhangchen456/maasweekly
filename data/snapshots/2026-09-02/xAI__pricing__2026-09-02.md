Which model should I choose?
Your choice depends on your use case. We have dedicated models and APIs for audio, image, and video capabilities. For everything else, including code, use Grok 4.6. It is the most intelligent and fastest model we’ve built.

Additional Information Regarding Models
No access to realtime events without search tools enabled
Grok has no knowledge of current events or data beyond what was present in its training data.
To incorporate realtime data with your request, enable server-side search tools (Web Search / X Search). See Web Search and X Search.
Chat models
No role order limitation: You can mix system, user, or assistant roles in any sequence for your conversation context.
logprobs and top_logprobs are not supported by models grok-4.20 and newer. These fields will be silently ignored if set.
Image input models
Maximum image size: 20MiB
Maximum number of images: No limit
Supported image file types: jpg/jpeg or png.
Any image/text input order is accepted (e.g. text prompt can precede image prompt)
Batch API
Not every model accepts Batch API requests. See Details on each model page.
The knowledge cut-off date of Grok 4.6 is February 1, 2026.
Model Aliases
Some models have aliases to help users automatically migrate to the next version of the same model. In general:
<modelname> is aliased to the latest stable version.
<modelname>-latest is aliased to the latest version. This is suitable for users who want to access the latest features.
<modelname>-<date> refers directly to a specific model release. This will not be updated and is for workflows that demand consistency.
For most users, the aliased <modelname> or <modelname>-latest are recommended, as you would receive the latest features automatically.
