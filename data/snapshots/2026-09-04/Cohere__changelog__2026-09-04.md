Meet Cohere Parse
Today we are releasing Cohere Parse.
Parse (model ID: parse-v5.0) turns complex documents into clean, structured Markdown ready for downstream AI workflows. The 2.3B-parameter multimodal model extracts text in reading order, tables, lists, forms, images and captions, page boundaries, and visual element locations.
Outputs include Markdown/HTML content, HTML-formatted tables, bounding boxes, and image descriptions — preserving both document structure and layout for easier rendering and processing.
Key specs: 8K context window · ~4.6GB model size · Markdown output
Availability
Cohere Parse is available through the Parse API, as well as Microsoft Foundry
and AWS SageMaker
.
For single-tenant deployment, Parse is also available in Model Vault.
For more details, see the model documentation.
Meet Cohere Transcribe Arabic
Today we are releasing Cohere Transcribe Arabic.
This open-source speech-to-text model is a fine-tune of Cohere Transcribe using Arabic speech data. It
lets Arabic speakers transcribe their voice with unmatched accuracy and support for regional dialects or
speech patterns.
It is currently the most accurate open-source Arabic ASR model available today and is optimized for
production inference and throughput.
Technical Details
Model Name: cohere-transcribe-arabic-07-2026
Size: 2B
Architecture: conformer-based encoder-decoder
Languages supported: Arabic (all major dialects), English (including English spoken with an
Arabic accent)
License: Apache 2.0
Availability
Cohere Transcribe Arabic is available through the V2 Audio Transcriptions API and as open weights on
Hugging Face
. For
production use, Model Vault deployment is also supported.
For more details, see the model documentation.
Announcing Cohere's North Mini Code
We’re pleased to announce the release of North Mini Code, Cohere’s first
agentic coding model. It is a 30 billion total / 3 billion active parameter Mixture of Experts model
trained specifically for agentic coding, with a small enough active footprint to run on local hardware.
Technical Details
Model Name: north-mini-code-1-0
Context Length: 256K input, 64K output
License: Apache 2.0
Availability
North Mini Code is available through the Chat V2 API and as open weights on Hugging Face. For

Announcing Cohere’s Command A+
We’re pleased to announce the release of Command A+, the last model in the Command A
family of models, combining support for vision inputs, reasoning capabilities, translation capabilities, and
agentic tasks all within the same model. It is also notably our first Mixture of Experts (MoE) model with 25
billion active parameters ands 218 billion total parameters.

You can start transcribing audio using the following example query:
PYTHON
| 1 | import cohere
| 2 |
| 3 | co = cohere.ClientV2()
| 4 |
| 5 | response = co.audio.transcriptions.create(
| 6 | model="cohere-transcribe-03-2026",

| 11 | print(response)
Availability
You can access Cohere Transcribe via our API
for free, low-setup experimentation
subject to rate limits. See the Different Types of API Keys and Rate Limits page for
usage details and integration guidance.
For production deployment without rate limits, provision a dedicated Model Vault.
This enables low-latency, private cloud inference without having to manage infrastructure. Pricing is
calculated per hour-instance, with discounted plans for longer-term commitments.
