Your First API Call
The DeepSeek API uses an API format compatible with OpenAI/Anthropic. By modifying the configuration, you can use the OpenAI/Anthropic SDK or softwares compatible with the OpenAI/Anthropic API to access the DeepSeek API.

| model(1) | deepseek-v4-flash
deepseek-v4-pro
deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp
(1) The deepseek-v4-flash model has been updated to DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731, and the deepseek-v4-pro model has been updated to DeepSeek-V4-Pro-0813. The calling method remains unchanged — simply use deepseek-v4-flash or deepseek-v4-pro to access the latest version. The newly released deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp is an experimental model that additionally accepts image input; set the model name to deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp to use it, and see Vision for details.
Integrate with Agent Tools​
DeepSeek Harness is now in developer preview for agent harness developers worldwide. See the DeepSeek Harness Guide for details.
The DeepSeek API is supported by many popular AI agent and coding assistant tools. If you use tools like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, or OpenCode, you can use DeepSeek as the backend model directly — no code required.
See the Agent Integrations Guide for details.
Invoke The Chat API​
Once you have obtained an API key, you can access the DeepSeek model using the following example scripts in the OpenAI API format. This is a non-stream example, you can set the stream parameter to true to get stream response.
For examples using the Anthropic API format, please refer to Anthropic API.
