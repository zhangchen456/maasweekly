grok-imagine-image-quality retirement on November 2
On November 2, 2026, grok-imagine-image-quality is retired. Requests to the slug will be served by grok-imagine-image-2.0 with quality set to low, with no change to the request or response shape and at a lower per-image price. grok-imagine-image (1.0) is not affected. See the migration guide.
August
August 28
Imagine image API updates
Auto quality. The quality parameter on grok-imagine-image-2.0 now accepts auto, and the default when quality is omitted has moved from medium to auto. Auto currently uses low for image generation and medium for image editing. Images are billed at the quality they are served at. Pass low or medium explicitly to pin a specific quality. See Image Generation.
Five reference images. Image editing now accepts up to 5 source images per request (was 3). See Multi-Image Editing.
New aspect ratios. Image generation and editing accept 21:9 (cinematic widescreen) and 5:2 (wide banners). See Image Generation.
August 12
Grok 4.6
Grok 4.6, SpaceXAI's frontier model for coding, agentic tasks, and knowledge work, is now available on the xAI API. It has a 500k context window, text and image inputs with text-only output, and no text output limit. Pricing is $2 / $0.50 / $6 per 1M tokens (input / cached input / output) below 200k prompt tokens, and $4 / $1 / $12 above. Reasoning effort supports low, medium, high (default), and xhigh. See the Grok 4.6 overview and the announcement.
August 11
Grok Bot
Grok Bot is now available. Durable AI teammates that work on a persistent cloud computer, with messaging, approvals, connectors, and routines. See the Grok Bot overview and Get started.
July
July 31
grok-imagine-video-1.5 modalities
grok-imagine-video-1.5 now supports text-to-video, image-to-video, and reference-to-video (including optional preset voices), with native 1080p for T2V and I2V. Text-to-video on this model runs as text-to-image then image-to-video under the hood. See Video Generation, Image-to-Video, and Reference-to-Video.
July 29
Grok Voice Think Fast 2.0 is available
grok-voice-think-fast-2.0 is now available with Speech to Speech. grok-voice-latest will route to this model starting August 5, 2026. To get started, see the Speech to Speech docs. For more details, see our announcement.
July 23
Adjustable VAD threshold for Speech to Text
Speech to Text now accepts a vad_threshold parameter (streaming query param and batch multipart field) to tune the voice-activity gate that skips non-speech audio. Lower values transcribe quieter or noisier speech — useful for narrowband telephony — and 0 disables the gate. See the Speech to Text docs.
July 17
Grok 4.5 available in the EU
Grok 4.5 is now available in the API console for EU users. See the Grok 4.5 overview.
July 8
Grok 4.5
Grok 4.5, SpaceXAI's model for coding, agentic tasks, and knowledge work, is now available on the xAI API. Priced at $2 / 1M input tokens and $6 / 1M output tokens, with configurable reasoning effort (low, medium, or high; default high). See the Grok 4.5 overview and the announcement.
June
June 15
Priority Processing
You can now request higher scheduling priority per request by setting service_tier: "priority" on text inference endpoints (Chat Completions and Responses). The response's service_tier field reports the tier actually applied, and priority rates are billed only when priority is used. For more details, see the Priority Processing docs.
June 10
Public URLs and Files API ↔ Imagine integration
Public URLs for Files — turn any file in your Files API storage into a permanent, unauthenticated URL that anyone can open, embed, or share. Revocable at any time, or set an auto-expiry between 1 hour and 30 days. See the Public URLs docs.
Reference stored files as Imagine inputs — substitute image_file_id, video_file_id, or reference_image_file_ids for URL inputs across every Imagine endpoint, with no need to re-upload bytes or make the file public. See Imagine → Files API Integration.
Persist Imagine outputs to Files — set storage_options on any Imagine request to save the generated asset to your Files storage; pair with storage_options.public_url to publish a shareable link in one round trip. See Imagine → Files API Integration.

May 29
Smart Turn for Streaming STT
The streaming Speech to Text API now supports Smart Turn end-of-turn detection. When enabled via the smart_turn query parameter, an ML model predicts whether the speaker has finished their thought at silence boundaries — reducing false endpointing during dictation, number sequences, and mid-sentence pauses. Use smart_turn_timeout to set a maximum silence fallback. For more details, see the Smart Turn docs.
May 29
Context Compaction
The Context Compaction API is now available. You can shrink long conversations into a shorter context and reuse it in follow-up requests for lower cost, faster time-to-first-token, and sharper responses on long agent loops. For more details, see the Context Compaction docs.
WebSocket Responses API Mode
WebSocket Responses API mode is now available. Drive the Responses API over a single, long-lived WebSocket connection for lower end-to-end latency on tool-heavy agent workloads. For more details, see the WebSocket Mode docs.
May 27
Image Search in Web Search
Web Search now supports explicitly searching for images. Enable enable_image_search to let Grok search directly for relevant images; responses can include returned images as Markdown image embeds. For details, see Enable Image Search.
May 19
